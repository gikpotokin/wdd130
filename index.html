        <h1>Godswill Moses Ikpotokin | WDD 130</h1>
        <img src="images/profile.jpeg" alt="Hello, my name is Godswill Moses Ikpotokin">
        <p>Hello! My name is Godswill Moses Ikpotokin and I am from Nigeria. I enjoy coding, exploring new technologies,
            creating web applications, reading about African culture and history, and solving real-world problems
            through technology.</p>
        <p>In my commitment to preserving our cultural heritage, I‚Äôve created a space on my website (ikpotokin.ng) where
            people can
            learn African proverbs and parables‚Äîempowering the next generation to embrace their identity with pride.

            I believe in holistic empowerment‚Äîwhere technology, culture, and mentorship work together to unlock Africa‚Äôs
            potential.

            At the heart of my mission is a deep conviction:
            ‚ÄúValues are the soul of humanity; without them, we become intelligent machines, not wise beings.‚Äù
            Africa, with its rich traditions, holds the moral compass for humanity. When technology is divorced from
            culture, we
            risk building power without wisdom‚Äîand that is a danger to us all. I believe African culture is essential in
            shaping the
            future of technology and grounding innovation in wisdom, compassion, and purpose.</p>
